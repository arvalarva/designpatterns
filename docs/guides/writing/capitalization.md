### Capitalization

#### General guidance
Follow a consistent capitalization scheme. Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

- Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies.
- Don’t capitalize <b>agile</b>, unless it is the first word of a sentence.
- Don’t capitalize <b>open source</b>, unless it is the first word of a sentence.
- Don’t capitalize <b>federal</b> or <b>government</b>.

When you’re deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality. Using it judiciously can help clarify that you’re speaking about a specific, official thing, such as a form, office, or person. Overuse can cause users stress by implying formality or officialness where it doesn’t exist. For instance:

- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase, <b>Declaration for Utility or Design Patent Application</b> because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse users to capitalize office actions or assignment recordation forms, because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

#####Personal titles
Don’t capitalize personal titles unless they precede a name. For example, the director visited Detroit or Director Lee visited Detroit. Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, we prefer firefighter to fireman and chairperson to chairman.

#####Headings
Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow sentence case. For example

- U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeks comment on new patent filing rules
- Search patent assignment

#####Answers to common capitalization questions
- The <b>Constitution</b> is capitalized.
- <b>American</b> or <b>Americans</b> are capitalized.
- Words such as <b>congressional</b>, <b>presidential</b>, and <b>national</b> are lower case unless they are the first word in a sentence or heading.
- <b>Web</b>, <b>webpage</b>, <b>website</b>, and <b>webmaster</b> are lower case unless they are the first word in a sentence or heading.
- The <b>internet</b> is lower case.

####USPTO-specific guidance 

- Use <b>Patents or <b>Trademarks when referring to the organizations within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
- The <b>office</b> and the <b>agency are not capitalized. On second reference to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, consider using the USPTO instead of the office or the agency.
