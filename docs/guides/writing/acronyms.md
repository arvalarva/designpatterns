### Acronyms and abbreviations

#### General guidance
Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. For example, writing St. instead of Street, or Rx for prescription, or DC for District of Columbia.

Acronyms are a type of abbreviation. They shorten phrases in a specific way, using parts of the initial word or phrase to form an abbreviation. For example, DIY, or ASAP.

In the most technical sense, there is a difference between acronyms—abbreviations pronounced as words, like NASA—and initialisms—abbreviations pronounced as letters, like FBI. For simplicity, our content guide refers to both as acronyms. The readability issues that acronyms and initialisms create tend to be similar, and “acronym” is the more common term.

Acronyms often confuse readers. Avoid them whenever possible.

If an acronym is necessary for future reference, spell out the full title and follow with the acronym in parentheses on the first reference. For example, the General Services Administration (GSA).

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For example, NASA, NAACP, and FBI. In such instances, the acronym is always acceptable, at the writer’s discretion.
At the writer’s discretion, refer to organizations on second reference with a shortened name instead of an acronym. For example, use Labor in place of Department of Labor, rather than DOL.

####USPTO-specific guidance 

- Do not refer to the USPTO as simply the PTO. When we became an agency with an independent budget, we became the USPTO. Please see the Federal Register for more information.
- USPTO does not have periods after each letter. DOC, which stands for the Department of Commerce, does not have periods. Most federal organizations do not, but make sure to research other organization writing guidelines.
- Use <b>the USPTO</b>."
- U.S. has periods after each letter when refering to the United States.
- The USPTO can be referred to as the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, on first reference. 
- Do not use the acronym DOC in content written for the public, when referring to the Deparment of Commerce. Use <b>Commerce Department</b>. See the AP Stylebook's "department" entry for more U.S. Cabinet guidelines.
- Do not abbreviate <b>department</b> in any usage.
