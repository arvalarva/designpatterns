### USPTO Writing Styleguide

#### Updated April 2017
This guide provides the standards that all business units of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) should follow in preparing publications for internal and external audiences. These standards should be used in preparing materials for internet and intranet websites.

Using this guide will help eliminate inconsistencies in spelling, punctuation, and grammar. It is based on the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.apstylebook.com">Associated Press (AP) Stylebook</a>, used by the media, corporations, and universities. It works well for online audiences who tend to scan content and prefer clear, concise content. 

This reference contains style guidelines specific to the USPTO and addresses frequently asked questions. For any additional editorial questions not addressed, please refer to the latest edition of the AP Stylebook. We also refer to the 18f (GSA) Content Guide for government-related questions not covered in the AP Stylebook or this guide.

Marketing, training, and employee-based communications should be submitted to the Office of the Chief Communications Officer (OCCO) at least 10 business days before your requested distribution or publishing date for both an editorial and graphics review. Fill out as much as you can on the OCCO Service Request Form and call 571-272-8400 if you have any questions.

For questions, contact the Office of the Chief Communications Officer at 571-272-8400. When in doubt, please call us or visit our office on the first floor of the west side of the Madison building on the USPTO’s Alexandria campus.


#### Why have a writing styleguide?

Our voice should demonstrate our commitment to quality, employees, constituents, public, and strategic goals. It must clearly communicate the organization’s mission, philosophy, and significance. It should be professional and friendly to our readers, without being overly casual. It should portray our commitment to open government communication. Additionally, styleguides help us focus on readability, ensuring readers absorb content quickly without stumbling over unnecessary capitalization and punctuation.
